# MathMind

A website to help practice mental math.  MathMind currently features addition, subtraction, and multiplication modes.  A primary goal was to practice my react skills, and this is still a work in progress.  MathMind uses an ASP.NET Core backend with a PostgreSQL database, and a react app with Material UI for the frontend.
